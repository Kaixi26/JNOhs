# JNOhs
Discord bot programmed in haskell.
## Why?
This is a project just for fun and to increase my haskell proficiency.
Inspired by [JBB.py](https://github.com/JoseFilipeFerreira/JBB.py).
## Compiling and running

To compile and run install [haskell stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
and edit the `discordToken` value in the
[src/Config.hs](https://github.com/Kaixi26/JNOhs/blob/master/src/Config.hs) file.

After that you can run/install with
```bash
stack run
```

```bash
stack install
```
